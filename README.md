--TODO app --

WHat does it need to have.

1. Editable input field for new TODO. 
2. On click it needs to add the TODO item to the list below. 
3. Once the TODO is added it needs to be able to remove it from the list. 
4. Needs to have 3 states. TODO -> In progress -> Completed. 
5. Need to implement a sidebar. 

Nice to have but not priority. 
- Reminder system. 
- login page. 
- profile  page
- database to store the profiles. # WhatTODO
