WHat does it need to have.

1. Editable input field for new TODO. --Check
2. On click it needs to add the TODO item to the list below. --Check 
3. Once the TODO is added it needs to be able to remove it from the list. --Check 
4. Needs to have 3 states. TODO -> In progress -> Completed. --Check
5. Needs to remove from todo section and add to in progress section.
